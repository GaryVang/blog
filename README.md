## What is this Blogging Website/Platform?

### Purpose

I decided on developing this blogging site/platform due to the simple fact that 
blogging is still popular and such a project would require me to learn many new skills: the most important ones being the front-end's consumption of an API and the management of user sessions through secure cookies.

### Planned updates and features

- Change password display to *
- Update responsiveness of website
- Add a method for pulling up a specific post
- Implement JWT for user authorization

## Technologies Used

- Front-end: ReactJS v16.13.1, HTML5, CSS3
- Back-end: PostgreSQL v12.4
- [RESTful-API:](https://github.com/GaryVang/blog-api-2) Express.js v4.17.1
